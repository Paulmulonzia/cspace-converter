The artist's work can be seen as representing elements found in nature, while maintaining a rich elegance. The paintings are resonant with color, ranging from earth tones to primary colors and everything in between. One color and its variations usually dominate a painting.

The new work combines 22 rolled steel plates, bolted end-to-end to create a giant looping coil. Park visitors can walk through and underneath the circling shapes. As they pass, drivers see flashing color shifts across the sculpture's metallic enamels.<br/>Baer feels that designing for indoor and outdoor public spaces is a favorite challenge: each sculpture must not only engage the eye and mind but also work well. Commissioned artworks evolve from the visual features of each site and reflections of the people who use the location. A successful work explores and celebrates its space, bringing humanizing grace, balance, and calm energy. Sculptures created for atriums or high-ceiling lobbies seem to float on their own buoyant spirits.","outdoor sculpture",Jazz,"powder coating",1999,"Barbara Baer",DOCA

His first objective was to portray the range of activities that might go on in advance of a grand night of opera. Ultimately, the artist selected each person and detail from hundreds of films, old photographs, paintings, illustrations, as well as new photographs of stage workers, friends, family and arts patrons. His second objective was for the mural to be as interesting from two hundred feet as from twenty. To meet this objective, the artist’s solution was to use a familiar four part image of a theater curtain, stage, orchestra pit and audience seating, and then give it a beehive-like quality.","mural paintings (visual works)","The Rehearsal","acrylic paint",2005,"Stephen Batura",DOCA

38821,"The concept for Camino originated from a common fact shared by two agencies that are housed within the same facility along Park Avenue in Denver, Colorado. That being that both agencies deal with roads and trails, or pathways through landscape. The artists goal was to illustrate this in an abstract way.<br/>Located at the end of the final turn in the entrance road that leads to this facility, the sculpture is seen mostly by the employees of the two agencies. Consisting of three tall wedges of stone, these modernist forms will be bunched together, slightly off set from one another. As one drives into the complex they eventually reach a particular spot in the road where your line of site perfectly lines up with two portals that are cut through the composition of stones. This “pathway” through the stand of stones is meant to convey the idea of a conduit, or road.

The artist’s vision for the piece was to create a manifestation of the athletic movements of the Skatepark users.  The two components of the sculpture bracket the stairs in the center of the park and give form to the beginning and end of an aerial stunt.  The larger element is anchored by a monumentally scaled wheel, tilted off plumb to evoke a sense of dynamism.  The elongated undulating plane atop the wheel, with a smaller wheel at its tip, references the launching into air.  The second element consists of a steel wheel atop a concrete arc, symbolizing the inevitable return to earth.

The structure was designed by William Ellsworth and Arthur Addison Fisher to resemble the Water Gateway at the 1893 Columbian Exposition.<br/>The large pond features two bronze sea lion sculptures with a young naked child sitting on the back of each seal. The child is depicted reaching around the seal's neck and grabbing at the water with delight as it sprays from the seal's mouth.

Just as wind vanes tell the direction of the wind, these monumental gateway elements tell the direction of the times in Denver’s history.<br/>The first “Time Vane” looks back more than 200 years to honor the Native American presence in the region. The second piece acknowledges the influence of the railroads during the prosperous silver boom of the 1880’s and ‘90’s. The third “Time Vane” reflects upon the visionary programs of Denver’s Mayor Speer, who launched the local “City Beautiful” movement and established Denver as an energy center for the West. The fourth piece looks into the future of the Valley, acknowledging the region’s growing technological significance as the nation’s “optical valley”.<br/>The last two, at the other end of the Viaduct, look at attitudes about time itself. One of them suggests a wheel-like movement that it measured and clock like - man-made. The other presents a sweeping motion like that of a sundial - continuous, flowing, and natural. This last “Time Vane” is recognition of man’s debt to nature, revealing that essential human rhythms are essentially celestial.","outdoor sculpture","Platte Valley Time Vanes","powder coating",,"David Griggs",DOCA

The facility provided plenty of opportunities for one or two large individual works of art.  However, the artist decided on multiple, grade-specific works to be placed throughout the school.<br/>Most of the objects in Life of the Mind are recognizable and highly sculptural.  They are located next to the classroom entryways, like nonverbal signage.  The colors are crisp and the textures are smooth.  The positioning of the forms is at eye level to the students and can be touched.  The artist designed Life of the Mind to ignite learning and to create a strong connection to place.""

39043,"The work, ‘ENGI’, was conceived specifically for the Denver Art Museum’s four-story atrium. Central to Tatsuo Miyajima's vision was the direct involvement of the people of Denver, making it a truly public piece of art. After a short lecture by Miyajima and brief instructions from volunteer staff, the workshop to create ‘ENGI’ began.  At the workshop, 80 members of the community each were given a simple digital LED numeric device, set within a mirror, to adjust for the artist.  The LEDs count from 1 to 9 or 9 to 1.  Each participant set the rate at which their device counts.<br/>The workshop was essential to give life to Miyajima’s ‘ENGI’.  After the workshop, the 80 LEDs, as set by the people of Denver, were installed throughout the museum atrium and began counting.  The LEDs, with their different colors—blue and white—and speeds, figuratively display a microcosm of the city of Denver and its residents.  Visitors stepping into the museum encounter the work in the atrium, and simultaneously see their own figures and the building reflected in the mirrors.  Through these layers of public participation, a resonance between the time setters and the visitors emerges and echoes within the building.
