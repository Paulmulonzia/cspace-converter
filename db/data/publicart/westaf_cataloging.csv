Each references a color and design seen in New Mexico's traditional buildings. The windows are mounted atop cast concrete benches (bancos), which also serve as seating for park visitors. They are installed on an arc, framing many points of view, be it the playground, basketball court, nearby businesses or the majestic Sandia Mountains.Sitting and observing one's surroundings through the windows is an invitation to slow down and appreciate one's place in the world. Hence, the title of the sculpture: You Are Here. May the community of Ventana Ranch enjoy their magnificent view from the windows for many years to come.

The piece is based on the theme of origin of the two volcanoes outside of Mexico City. Native Americans in the valley of Mexico believed the volcanoes were ill-fated lovers turned into mountains by the Gods, who felt compassion for them. I like the universal quality of the story and the fact that the image is a widely used image within the Mexican-American community in the United States from Texas to California. I have used the piece to also include the eagle, the rattlesnake and the cactus, which along with the mountains play an important part in the religion and ritual of Native Americans.

It is a contemporary piece about light and animation; something that references nature in an ever changing way-like nature herself.  I am working with metallic leaf, composite materials of aluminum and brass, applied in thin layers with varnish to the surface of prepared panels.  I let the leafing make it's way to the tacky varnish when it is almost but not fully dry and with the lightest touch like a feather, press it down.  Sometimes a whole leaf will adhere perfectly without a blemish but more often, it cracks, splits apart and reveals the under-color in the process. I have to accept the organic aspects of this medium and surrender to the nature of the delicate material.   The grid structure the shiny square pieces applied in formation along side the unexpected irregular breaks give the pieces both order and chaos, something like a garden. But it is the way the overall effect of the metallic finish reflects light that I most respond to.",paintings (visual works),Red-factor,cited,oil paint (pigmented coating),2013,creation,,,,Deborah Gavel,artist,person,Albuquerque Public Art,organization
