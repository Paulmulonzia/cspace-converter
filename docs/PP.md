# PastPerfect

```
NOTE When exporting data to Excel, each field is limited to 254 characters. In most cases this wonâ€™t be a problem, except for data in unlimited memo fields like Description and Notes. If you want to export data that is longer than 254 characters, please choose the Excel/HTML option. This export creates an HTML (.htm) file that is opened in Excel. To save this file as an Excel file (.xls), please use the Save As option in Excel.
```

For earlier versions of Past Perfect (< 5) you may need to manually clean up long fields (> 254 characters) to avoid export truncation.

```
./bin/rake db:nuke
